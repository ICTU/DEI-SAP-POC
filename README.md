## Content
This repo contains the elaborations of developing and testing a Rules Service that:

1. Performs legal checks based on the verifiable presentation and proof presented to it by the SAP System.

2. Returns a response to the SAP System as to whether the real estate transaction can proceed (i.e. legally seller allowed to sell and buyer allowed to buy).

3. Will be stand-alone and not integrated with any productive system.
